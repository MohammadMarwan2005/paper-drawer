## 🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Paper Drawer App! 📱

As part of my Data Structures and Algorithms 2 collage course, I developed an innovative Android app that tackles a fascinating problem:

## 📄 The Challenge:
Any paper has a length and width. When we have multiple papers, how can we arrange them to form larger shapes, whether rectangular or not? For example:
Paper A: [100, 50]
Paper B: [50, 50]
We can arrange them side-by-side: A[100, 50] | B[50, 50]
Or stack them: A[100, 50] - B[50, 50]

## 🛠️ Key Features of Paper Drawer:
1. Tree Data Structure: Build a tree representing complex paper arrangements.
2. String Representation: Import/export tree structures using intuitive string formats.
3. UI Conversion: Convert a tree to a UI using recursion.
4. Rectangle Check: Determine if the final arrangement is a rectangle.
5. Rotation: Rotate paper arrangements.
6. All Possible Rectangles: Generate all potential rectangular arrangements from a set of papers.

This project was a tremendous learning experience, especially in:
- Constructing and manipulating tree data structures
- Converting a tree to a UI using recursion
- Solving complex algorithmic problems
